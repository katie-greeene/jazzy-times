    <h2>Favorite Lyrics</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><p>"My life seems unreal, my crime an illusion,<br>
              a scene badly written in which I must play.<br>
              Yet I know as I gaze at my young love beside me<br>
              the morning is just a few hours away."</p>

      <li><p>"For I know with the first light of dawn I'll be leaving<br>
              and tonight will be all I have left to recall."</p>
    </ol>
