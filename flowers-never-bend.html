    <h2>Favorite Lyrics</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><p class = 'synopsis'>"It's no matter if you're born to play the king or pawn<br>
              for the line is thinly drawn between joy and sorrow.<br>
              So my fantasy becomes reality<br>
              and I must be what I must be and face tomorrow."</p>

      <li><p>"So I'll continue to  continue<br>
              to pretend my life will never end<br>
              and flowers never bend with the rainfall."</p>

      <li><p>"I am blinded by the light<br>
              of God, and truth, and right<br>
              and I wander in the night without direction."</p>
    </ol>
